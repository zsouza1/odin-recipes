        <h4>A delicious and easy to prepare 5 ingredient rib eye roast</h4>
        <p>I make this rib-eye roast on the bone every time rib eyes are on sale. Easy and delicious; there are never any leftovers! We usually cook ours medium-rare.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup softened butter</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in rib-eye roast</li>
            <li>sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Gather all the ingredients and preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>

        <p>Poke several holes in rib eye with a sharp knife. Rub butter mixture all over meat and season with salt and pepper. Place rib eye fat-side up in a roasting  pan.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) and continue cooking until rib eye is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. An instant-read</p>
        <p>thermometer inserted into the center will read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) for medium.</p>
