        <p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel</p> 
        <p>seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Step 6</strong></p>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degreed C).</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7</strong></p>
        <p>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.</p>
        <p>Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 8</strong></p>
        <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</p>
